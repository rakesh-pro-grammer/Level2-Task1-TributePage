            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Dr. Kalam was raised in a modest family. 
               His father was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, while his mother was a housewife. 
               Despite financial challenges, his parents instilled in him a deep sense of discipline, honesty, and 
               a love for learning. Kalam worked as a newspaper vendor to support his education during his early years, 
               demonstrating his commitment to his studies and his determination to succeed.</p>

            <h3>Education and Early Career</h3>
            <p>Dr. Kalam's academic journey began in Rameswaram, where he completed his primary education. 
               His passion for learning and his fascination with flight led him to pursue a degree in Physics 
               from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli. He later moved to Madras (now Chennai) to study 
               aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT). It was here that he honed his 
               technical skills and developed a deep understanding of aeronautics.</p>
            <p>After graduating, Dr. Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research 
               and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. He later moved to the Indian Space Research 
               Organisation (ISRO), where he made significant contributions to India's space program. His work on the 
               development of the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) was a key milestone in India's space history, as 
               it successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in orbit.</p>

            <h3>Scientific Career and Contributions</h3>
            <p>Dr. Kalam's career in science and technology is marked by numerous accomplishments. 
               He played a pivotal role in the development of India's first indigenous guided missile program, 
               which earned him the nickname "Missile Man." Under his leadership, the Integrated Guided Missile 
               Development Programme (IGMDP) led to the successful launch of missiles like Agni, Prithvi, Akash, 
               Trishul, and Nag, significantly strengthening India's defense capabilities.</p>
            <p>His expertise was not limited to missile technology; he also contributed to the Pokhran-II nuclear 
                tests in 1998, which positioned India as a nuclear-armed state. Dr. Kalam's work was driven by his 
                belief in the power of science and technology to solve the challenges faced by the nation and to 
                improve the lives of its citizens.</p>
